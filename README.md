# DEM_ConnectedComponents
Connected Components (CC) from longitudinal river profiles for debris flow mapping.

This research and the code are associated with Mueting et al. (in review). Please cite this study when using the code.

# Installation and Processing
A detailed step-by-step processing in Jupyter Notebook format is described in the example directory. In short, you will need to install an environment containing the required python packages:
```
conda create -y --name DEM_CC
conda activate DEM_CC
conda install -y jupyter ipykernel pandas numpy geopandas rasterio matplotlib scipy kneed scikit-image tqdm seaborn
```

Second, install DEM_ConnectedComponents and set path:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/UP-RS-ESP/DEM_ConnectedComponents.git\n",
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:./~/DEM_ConnectedComponents/src
```

Third, install LSDTopoTools:
```
cd ~
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_Edinburgh_scripts/master/LSDTT_native_linux_setup.sh
sh LSDTT_native_linux_setup.sh
export PATH=$PATH:~/LSDTopoTools/LSDTopoTools2/bin
```

Now you can start using the ConnectedComponent package - see the example folder and Jupyter Notebook for a walk through on an example dataset (3m).
